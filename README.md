MEG Sustained response analyses and source localization

This repository contains the MEG analysis code to reproduce the analyses reported in  "Discovery, Interruption, and Updating of Auditory Regularities in Memory: Evidence from
Low-Frequency Brain Dynamics in Human MEG" published in The Journal of Neuroscience and available at  https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.28.645906 

    The MEG was recorded with CTF-275 MEG system (274 channels) at sampling rate of 600 Hz during passive sound stimulation.
    For analysis script, you need to download fieldtrip (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/), NoiseTools MATLAB toolbox (http://audition.ens.fr/adc/NoiseTools/overview.html) and SPM 12.
